--DESCIPTION:
The game is a simple Bullet Hell Shooting Game made with C# using MonoGame and Visual Studio 19.

The menu is a simple menu allowing the player to choose play and quit.

The game will be broken up in 4 phases with waves of enemies moving from top to bottom
in different patterns. At the end of each stage the player must either defeat a stage boss
or survive long enough for the stageboss to retriet. The stage bosses have health, making
it challenging for the player to survive.

The player will be able to pick up special items, such as bombs, extra life, or speed boosts,
periodically throughout the game to assist in survival. The player will also be able to switch
between different gun types.

The enemy hoards consists of 4 different enemy types. 

The player will start with three lives. The game will keep player score so the player can look 
at end score and top 10 scores.

			bottom in a straight line in random patterns (wedges, lines, double lines).
