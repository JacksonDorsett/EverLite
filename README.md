## About EverLite

EverLite is a space themed `bullet hell` game where the player must survive multiple waves of enemy ships and boss ships to go down in history as the best space pilot ever (at least in the game, this is not `The Last Starfighter` after all).

During gameplay the player flies his spaceship, armed only with a plasma blaster and nerves of steel. As the game progresses the player will have the opportunity to pick up new weapons and extra lives to assist in survival.

WARNING: The enemy waves will attack you from multiple directions and fly in seemingly random patterns... 
         (Or is their a reason behind there alien thinking?)
```
